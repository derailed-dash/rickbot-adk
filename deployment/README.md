# Deployment

This directory contains the Terraform configurations for provisioning the necessary Google Cloud infrastructure for your agent.

It was originally created and deployed using the `agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` command from the root of the project. For detailed information on the deployment process, infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines, please refer to the official documentation:

**[Agent Starter Pack Deployment Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/deployment.html)**

Subsequent deployment runs can easily be invoked using `make terraform` from the project root.

## Deployment Overview

### Environment Management: Staging and Production

This project utilizes distinct Google Cloud Projects to manage **staging** and **production** environments. This separation ensures isolation and allows for independent testing and deployment workflows.

*   **Project IDs:** The specific Google Cloud Project IDs for these environments are defined as variables in `deployment/terraform/variables.tf` (e.g., `prod_project_id`, `staging_project_id`).
*   **Variable Assignment:** The actual values for these project IDs are assigned in `deployment/terraform/vars/env.tfvars`.
*   **Environment Grouping:** The `deployment/terraform/locals.tf` file groups these project IDs into a `deploy_project_ids` map, which facilitates iteration and consistent application of configurations across environments within Terraform.

### Variable Definition and Usage

*   **Definition (`deployment/terraform/variables.tf`):** This file declares all input variables for the Terraform configuration.
*   **Assignment (`deployment/terraform/vars/env.tfvars`):** This file is used to assign concrete values to the variables declared in `variables.tf`. This allows for environment-specific configurations.

### CI/CD Pipeline Creation

The entire CI/CD pipeline for this project was initially set up using the `uvx agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` command. This command automates several critical steps:

1.  **GitHub Repository Creation:** It can create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2.  **CI/CD Runner Connection:** It connects your GitHub repository to your chosen CI/CD runner (e.g., Google Cloud Build or GitHub Actions).
3.  **Infrastructure Provisioning:** It provisions the necessary staging and production infrastructure in your Google Cloud projects.
4.  **Deployment Triggers:** It configures deployment triggers based on your repository's activity (e.g., pull requests, merges to `main`).

It has since been modified extensively.

### Cloud Build Integration

This project leverages Google Cloud Build for its CI/CD workflows. The build configurations are defined in the `.cloudbuild/` directory:

*   **`pr_checks.yaml` (CI Pipeline):**
    *   **Trigger:** Activated on pull request creation or updates.
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures code quality and functionality before merging.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Installs Python dependencies using `uv`.
        *   Runs unit tests (`pytest src/tests/unit`).
        *   Runs integration tests (`pytest src/tests/integration`).
*   **`staging.yaml` (Staging CD Pipeline):**
    *   **Trigger:** Activated on merges to the `main` branch.
    *   **Purpose:** Builds, tests, and deploys the application to the staging environment.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **Build:** Builds the Docker image of the application and tags it with the `SHORT_SHA` (commit SHA).
        *   **Push:** Pushes the built Docker image to Artifact Registry.
        *   **Deploy to Staging:** Deploys the image to a Cloud Run service in the staging project. Environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `MODEL`) are passed via `--set-env-vars`.
        *   **Trigger Prod Deployment:** After a successful staging deployment, it triggers the production deployment Cloud Build job.
    *   **Substitutions:** Uses Cloud Build substitutions (e.g., `_STAGING_PROJECT_ID`, `_REGION`, `_SERVICE_NAME`) to dynamically configure the build and deployment based on environment-specific values.
*   **`deploy-to-prod.yaml` (Production Deployment):**
    *   **Trigger:** Manually triggered after a successful staging deployment (often with a manual approval step in Cloud Build).
    *   **Purpose:** Deploys the *same* container image that was tested in staging to the production environment.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Deploys the pre-built and tested image to a Cloud Run service in the production project.
    *   **Substitutions:** Similar to staging, it uses substitutions (e.g., `_PROD_PROJECT_ID`, `_SERVICE_NAME`) to ensure the correct production environment is targeted.

### Iteration and Environment Specifics in CI/CD

The CI/CD pipelines are designed to handle multiple environments through:

*   **Project ID Variables:** Cloud Build substitutions like `_STAGING_PROJECT_ID` and `_PROD_PROJECT_ID` are used in the `.cloudbuild` YAML files to ensure that deployments target the correct Google Cloud Project based on the environment.
*   **Shared Image:** The same Docker image built and tested in the staging pipeline is promoted to production, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of environment-specific issues.
*   **Environment Variables:** Application configurations (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL`, `MODEL`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`) are passed as environment variables during deployment, allowing for environment-specific tuning.

### Additional Useful Information

*   **Convenience Commands:** The `Makefile` in the project root provides several convenient commands for development and deployment:
    *   `make install`: Installs Python dependencies using `uv`.
    *   `make terraform`: Applies the Terraform configurations.
    *   `make backend`: Builds and deploys the agent to Cloud Run.
    *   `make playground`: Starts a local web UI for interactive agent testing.
