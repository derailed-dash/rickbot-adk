# Specification - UI Refinements: Enhanced Layout & Assets

## Overview
Further refine the Rickbot-ADK React frontend by improving layout consistency and visual prominence of key interaction elements. Specifically, match the heights of the input field and the Send button, and increase the visual impact of the custom Portal Gun icon.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Unified Input Row Height**:
    *   Adjust the "Send" button height to exactly match the `TextField` height in the chat input row.
    *   Ensure the alignment is perfectly centered vertically.
2.  **Increased Icon Prominence**:
    *   Increase the size of the `PortalGunIcon` within the Send button to make it more recognizable and satisfying to click.

## Non-Functional Requirements
*   **UI Consistency**: Maintain the "Rick and Morty" dark theme and Portal Green accents.
*   **Responsiveness**: Ensure the unified height looks good across different screen widths.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The Send button and text input field have identical vertical heights.
*   The Portal Gun icon is visually larger than its previous iteration.
*   The layout remains stable and aligned.
