# Product Guidelines: Rickbot-ADK

## Voice and Tone
- **Primary Voice:** **The Guide.** The application speaks to the user with a helpful, clear, and slightly whimsical voice, acting as a knowledgeable assistant in a vast sci-fi universe.
- **Tone:** **Interactive and Dynamic.** The experience is designed to feel alive, using real-time streaming, animations, and immediate visual feedback to engage the user and highlight the underlying AI's capabilities.

## Brand Messaging
- **Fun First:** The core goal is to provide an entertaining and unique experience. Interactions should be memorable and persona-consistent.
- **Educational Secondary:** While fun is the priority, the application should subtly showcase the power and flexibility of the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Visual Identity & UI Design
- **Thematic Consistency:** The UI should incorporate visual elements that reflect the diverse personas. This includes using distinct avatars (e.g., Rick, Yoda, Jack Burton) and thematic icons that ground the experience in their respective worlds.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Use streaming text effects and loading states that keep the user informed and engaged during complex AI operations.

## User Interaction Guidelines
- **Persona-Centric Errors:** When something goes wrong, the application should handle it "in-character" where possible. For example, Rick might deliver a cynical error message, while Yoda might offer a cryptic but helpful observation about the mistake.
- **Persona-Led Onboarding:** New users should be introduced to the application's features by the personas themselves. Instead of a standard tutorial, a character like Rick or Yoda should "break the fourth wall" to explain how to interact with the bot.

## Content Standards
- **Authenticity:** All persona responses must strive for high authenticity to their source material, capturing the unique vocabulary, speech patterns, and attitudes of characters like Rick Sanchez or Yoda.
- **Irreverence:** Maintain a playful and slightly irreverent edge that matches the project's inspiration, ensuring the experience remains "fun" and not overly formal.
