## Initial Concept
A multi-personality AI chatbot built using Google Gemini and the Agent Development Kit (ADK), allowing users to interact with personas like Rick Sanchez, Yoda, and others.

## Target Audience
- Fans of the various integrated personas (Rick Sanchez, Yoda, etc.).
- Anyone looking for a fun, engaging, and unique chatbot experience.
- Developers and Google Cloud users interested in exploring Agent Development Kit (ADK) and generative AI capabilities.

## Primary Goals
- **Engagement:** Provide a playful and irreverent conversational experience that captures the essence of diverse personalities.
- **Reference Implementation:** Serve as a comprehensive guide and reference for using Google Cloud ADK and the Agent-Starter-Pack in a real-world application.
- **Capability Showcase:** Demonstrate advanced generative AI features, including multimodal interactions (text/image) and real-time response streaming.

## Key Features
- **Diverse Personas:** Support for multiple distinct personalities with dynamic selection via the API.
- **Secure Authentication:** Integrated Google and GitHub OAuth for personalized and secure user sessions.
- **Real-time Streaming:** Seamless, real-time response streaming for a more natural conversation flow.

## Success Criteria
- **Educational Value:** The code is clear, well-documented, and serves as an effective learning resource for the developer community.
- **Operational Stability:** Successful deployment and consistent, stable operation on Google Cloud Vertex AI.
